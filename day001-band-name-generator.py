# In this lesson I learned how to use the print function, input function, and variables. 
# I also learned that creating a new line in strings is defined by \n, and the + symbol can be used to add strigns together.

print("Hello! I will help you create a band name. Let's get started.")
city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
petname = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + petname + ".")
